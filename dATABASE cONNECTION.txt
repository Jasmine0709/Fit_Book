For the Fit Book application, the anticipated collections (high-level table names) could include: 

Users: This collection would store information about each user of the Fit Book app, such as their username, email, and password. 

Workouts: This collection would store details about each workout session, such as the date, time, and type of exercises performed. 

Exercises: This collection would store information about individual exercises, such as their name, muscle group targeted, and any additional details. 

Body Measurements: This collection would store data related to the user's body measurements, such as their height, weight, and any custom measurements they choose to track. 

Muscle Groups: This collection would store information about different muscle groups, which can be used for categorizing exercises and workouts. 

These collections would help organize the data in the Fit Book database and provide a structured way for the application to store and retrieve information about users, their workouts, and their bodyÂ measurements.
